The main target audience of the app is farmers. Keeping this in mind, the app has been developed with a super easy interface and less-educated farmers should be able to use it comfortably as well. The app helps farmers to access the weather forecast at their current location and make the decision accordingly. Internet is full of information but accessing it is a major challenge for a non-English speaker, the app intends to solve this problem to give direct access to such useful websites in their choice of language. There are a large number of crops that a user can potentially plant, so this app includes a crop suggestion feature along with a fertilizer calculator and provide a proper plan for the cultivation of a selected crop. The selection of crop automatically subscribes the user to the forums of that selected crop, where users can share their queries. Every user subscribed to the same forum or crop will able to help each other and share their experiences. A careful balance is exercised between the comfort of use and abundancy of important features
